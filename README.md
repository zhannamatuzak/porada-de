# Porada-de

Porada-de is a site that provides information about the project ‚ÄúPorada-de‚Äù for Ukrainians in Germany. This project is an existing project that started at the end of July 2022. The site will be targeted toward refugees and migrants who are looking for advice about the German legal and bureaucratic system. This site will be useful for those who want to join the team, collaborate, or donate. The project exists as a Facebook page, where the posts are published weekly and then discussed in our [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642363020399443) (group). The group has over 37 thousand members. The group grows dynamically and needs urgently more people to advise and write posts. That is why the main aim is to attract people who want to contribute to the project and, therefore, to the community.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar and Logo__

* Navigation bar and Logo are positioned at the top of the page and placed in the header.
* Logo of the project is on the left side of the header. It is the word Porada-de which begins with the capital letter and then contains the lowercase letters. There is a scales symbol as well shown on the favicon. The scales symbol is a part of the logo. It is not to see in the header for design reasons. The main reason is that the scales are already on the main image on Home page. This idea is borrowed from the Code Institute website.
* Navigation bar is on the right side of the header. It contains navigation links. These are:
  * Home - leads to the Home page, where users can learn about the project Porada-de.
  * About Us - leads to the About page, where users can find information about the founders.    
  * Contact - leads to the contact form page, where users can fill out the form to become a part of a team or to collaborate.
  * Donate - leads to the Donation page of our organization [Soliduarity e. V..](https://www.soliduarity.org/donate/). The Donate link has a heart icon and is designed like a button so the visitor understands that the link has an additional donate function.
* The links have a hover effect. The color of the hover is the brand color of our project which is Clam Shell.
* The navigation is clear and easy to understand for the user.

![Navbar and Logo](documentation/navbar-logo.png)

* The navigation bar and Logo are responsive:
  * On tablet screens: navigation bar and logo organize a column, where all elements are centered.

![Navbar and Logo for tablets Tablets](documentation/navbar-logo-tablet.png)

  * On mobile devices screens, navigation bar and logo look the same as on the tablet screens.

- __The Landing Page (Main image) image__

* The Main image represents the focus of the project which is the legal and bureaucratic system. The scales on it are a part of our logo. The members of our community recognize it because its design is very similar to the cover image of the Facebook page of the project.

- __Project Ethos Section__

* The Project Ethos section will allow the user to learn about the project and its spectrum of topics. This should encourage the user to consider joining our Facebook community and help the members with advice. It has a link to the project's Organization.
* It consists of two subsections: the project description and the topics list subsections.

![Project Ethos section](documentation/project-ethos-screenshot.png)

![Footer](documentation/footer-screenshot.png)

- __Team Information Section__

- __Contact Form__ 

### Features Left to Implement

- The About page will be improved by adding photos and personal information of all team members. The team members are already asked to prepare photos and descriptions about themselves. As the page About Us has the aim to attract the new team members, it should be more appealing and contain personal information and the information of all team members.

- The form on Contact page will be improved as well. It should be added one more box with a dropdown list with predefined topic options. The reason for this is to give options for possible decisions: to ‚Äújoin", ‚Äúto collaborate‚Äù, ‚Äúto ask a general question‚Äù, ‚Äúto ask a specific question‚Äù. It is not integrated yet because it is not discussed with all team members.

- Also the Facebook Community page should be added. It could be very useful because the [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642363020399443) is closed and to become a member the person has to meet certain criteria.

## Design

* The Design of this website is based on the design of the Facebook page of the project [Porada-de.](https://www.facebook.com/PoradaDE)

![Design roots](documentation/facebook-page-design.png)

### Color

- The two colors were used to design this website. The reason is that it is recommended for non-designers to use no more than two colors.

- Clam Shell color was used to hoover navigation bar links,social media links and scroll on top button, as a background for project Description subsection, form section, and Response section.

- Shamrock color was used to design header, footer, background of topic list subsection, and Submit button.

![Website-colors](documentation/website-colors.png)

The usage of two colors could be boring for some visitors and they could leave the website. In order to keep up the user motivation and to improve use experiences, the modest background pattern was used.

![Main-background](documentation/main-background.png)

The Subtle Gradient Pattern Background for the main was used from the [freefrontend](https://freefrontend.com/css-background-patterns/).
