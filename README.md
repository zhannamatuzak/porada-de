# Porada-de

Porada-de is a site that provides information about the project ‚ÄúPorada-de‚Äù for Ukrainians in Germany. This project is an existing project that started at the end of July 2022. The site will be targeted toward refugees and migrants who are looking for advice about the German legal and bureaucratic system. This site will be useful for those who want to join the team, collaborate, or donate. The project exists as a Facebook page, where the posts are published weekly and then discussed in our [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642363020399443) (group). The group has over 37 thousand members. The group grows dynamically and needs urgently more people to advise and write posts. That is why the main aim is to attract people who want to contribute to the project and, therefore, to the community. My friend Vira and I are founders of the Porada-de project.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar and Logo__

  - Navigation bar and Logo are positioned at the top of the page and placed in the header.
  - Logo of the project is on the left side of the header. It is the word Porada-de which begins with the capital letter and then contains the lowercase letters. There is a scales symbol as well shown on the favicon. The scales symbol is a part of the logo. It is not to see in the header for design reasons. The main reason is that the scales are already on the main image on Home page. This idea is borrowed from the Code Institute website.
  - Navigation bar is on the right side of the header. It contains navigation links. These are:
    - Home - leads to the Home page, where users can learn about the project Porada-de.
    - About Us - leads to the About page, where users can find information about the founders.    
    - Contact - leads to the contact form page, where users can fill out the form to become a part of a team or to collaborate.
    - Donate - leads to the Donation page of our organization [Soliduarity e. V..](https://www.soliduarity.org/donate/) The Donate link has a heart icon and is designed like a button so the visitor understands that the link has an additional donate function.
  - The links have a hover effect. The color of the hover is the brand color of our project which is Clam Shell.
  - The navigation is clear and easy to understand for the user.

![Navbar and Logo](documentation/navbar-logo.png)

  - The navigation bar and Logo are responsive.
  - On tablet screens: navigation bar and logo organize a column, where all elements are centered.

![Navbar and Logo for tablets Tablets](documentation/navbar-logo-tablet.png)

  - On mobile devices screens, navigation bar and logo look the same as on the tablet screens.

- __The Landing Page (Main image) image__

  - The Main image represents the focus of the project which is the legal and bureaucratic system. The scales on it are a part of our logo. The members of our community recognize it because its design is very similar to the cover image of the Facebook page of the project.

![Main Image](assets/images/justice.jpg)

- __Project Ethos Section__

  - The Project Ethos section will allow the user to learn about the project and its spectrum of topics. This should encourage the user to consider joining our Facebook community and help the members with advice. It has a link to the project's Organization.
  - It consists of two subsections: the project description and the topics list subsections.

![Project Ethos section](documentation/project-ethos-screenshot.png)

- __Video Project Section__

  - The Video Project Section contains eight videos that are made by the team. This section will allow the user to see exactly what kinds of topics are covered on the videos.
  - This section will be updated as the new videos come in the course of time to keep the user up to date.

  - It also has a button Scross on Top that directs to the beginning of Home page.
‚Äã

![Project Ethos section](documentation/video-project-screenshot.png)

- __The Footer__ 

  - The Footer section includes four links to the relevant social media sites for Porada-de. The Facebook and Youtube links are existing links to the project. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

![Footer](documentation/footer-screenshot.png)

- __Team Information Section__ 

  - The Team Information Section will provide the user with information about the project's founders: their names and links to their Facebook profiles.
This section is useful to the user as they will be able to easily contact the founders only by clicking on the Facebook button.

  - It also has a button Scross on Top that directs to the beginning of the About page.

![Team Information Section](documentation/team-information.png)

- __Contact Form Section__ 

  - This page will allow the user to leave a message to the Porada-de team to join the team or to collaborate. The user will be asked to submit their name, email address, and state and write a message.

![Contact Form](documentation/contact-form-screenshot.png)

- __Response Section__ 

  - Response page appears after submitting the contact form.
  - It contains the "Thank you!" message.
  - It will automatically direct the user to the main page in 10 seconds.

![Response page](documentation/response-page-screenshot.jpeg)

- __Favicon__

For favicon I used our project's logo from the Facebook page.

![Favicon](favicon/apple-touch-icon.png)

### Features Left to Implement

- The About page will be improved by adding photos and personal information of all team members. The team members are already asked to prepare photos and descriptions about themselves. As the page About has the aim to attract new team members, it should be more appealing and contain personal information and the information of all team members.

- The form on the Contact page will be improved as well. It should be added one more box with a dropdown list with predefined topic options. The reason for this is to give options for possible decisions: to ‚Äújoin", ‚Äúto collaborate‚Äù, ‚Äúto ask a general question‚Äù, or ‚Äúto ask a specific question‚Äù. It is not integrated yet because it is not discussed with all team members.

- Also the Facebook Community page should be added. It could be very useful because the [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642363020399443) is closed and to become a membe, a person has to meet certain criteria. 

## Technologies and Tools Used

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) was used as the foundation of the site.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css) - was used to add the styles and layout of the site.
- [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - was used to arrange items on the pages and to make them responsive.
- [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) - along with flext box was used to make Topics list subsection responsive.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to make wireframes for the website.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used as the main tool to write and edit code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for the version control of the website.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to host the code of the website.
- [Birme](https://www.birme.net/) was used to resize Main image on the landing page.
- [Square my Image](https://squaremyimage.com/) was used to resize co-founder images to a square on the About page.
- [I love image](https://www.iloveimg.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) was used to adopt images for README.md file.
- [WenMart](https://www.webmart.de/) was used to find a second suitable color to my already picked color.

## Design

* The Design of this website is based on the design of the Facebook page of the project [Porada-de.](https://www.facebook.com/PoradaDE). The design ideas belongs to the founders (to my friend Vira and me).

![Design roots](documentation/facebook-page-design.png)

### Color

- The two colors were used to design this website. The reason is that it is recommended for non-designers to use no more than two colors.

- Clam Shell color was used to hoover navigation bar links,social media links and scroll on top button, as a background for project Description subsection, form section, and Response section.

- Shamrock color was used to design header, footer, background of topic list subsection, and Submit button.

![Website-colors](documentation/website-colors.png)

- The usage of two colors could be boring for some visitors and they could leave the website. 
In order to keep up the user motivation and to improve user experiences, the [the Subtle Gradient Pattern Background](documentation/main-background.png) was used for the main content from the [freefrontend.](https://freefrontend.com/css-background-patterns/). 
The code is to find [here.](https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/pGNVwZ) 

### Typography

* Two fonts were used in this project such as Oswald for the logo and heading 2 and Source-Sans-3 for the body elements. Oswald font is already used for titles of posters and presentations of the Porada-de project. Source-Sans-3 was generated as a suitable font for Oswald.

### Accessibility and performance 

- Using Lighthouse in devtools I confirmed that the website is performing well, accessible and colors and fonts chosen are readable.

#### Unfixed bugs

- The best practices score on the Home page is weighted only 83% because:

   - Largest Contentful Paint element is found;
   - In the Video Project section, it is said that the videos are loading slowly;
   - Two elements have large layouts shifts. I have tried to avoid it by implementing a hamburger menu. Unfortunately, I failed to implement it. It will be solved with Java Script later on.

- The accessibility score on the Response page is weighted 89% because:

  - If the purpose of the <meta> element is to refresh the page, this should be handled through JavaScript. This issue will be solved using Java Script later on.

### Fixed Bugs

 1. The header elements were not responsive because it was used float.
*Solution:* Instead of floats were used flexbox and grid layouts.

2. The elements changed their positions.
*Solution:* The parent element was given width and height.

3. The videos from YouTube in the video project section ware not shown. 
*Solution:* The embed links to videos ware copied on YouTube.
