- __Scroll on top button__ 

- __The Footer__ 

- __Team Information__ 

- __Contact Form__ 

### Features Left to Implement

- The About page will be improved by adding photos and personal information of all team members. The team members are already asked to prepare photos and descriptions about themselves. As the page About Us has the aim to attract the new team members, it should be more appealing and contain personal information and the information of all team members.

- The form on Contact page will be improved as well. It should be added one more box with a dropdown list with predefined topic options. The reason for this is to give options for possible decisions: to “join", “to collaborate”, “to ask a general question”, “to ask a specific question”. It is not integrated yet because it is not discussed with all team members.

- Also the Facebook Community page should be added. It could be very useful because the [Facebook community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/642363020399443) is closed and to become a member the person has to meet certain criteria.

## Design

### Color

- The two colors were used to design this website. The reason is that it is recommended for non-designers to use no more than two colors.

- Clam Shell color was used to hoover navigation bar links,social media links and scroll on top button, as a background for project Description subsection, form section, and Response section.

- Shamrock color was used to design header, footer, background of topic list subsection, and Submit button.

![Website-colors](documentation/website-colors.png)

The usage of two colors could be boring for some visitors and they could leave the website. In order to keep up the user motivation and to improve use experiences, the modest background pattern was used.

![Main-background](documentation/main-background.png)

The Subtle Gradient Pattern Background for the main was used from the [freefrontend](https://freefrontend.com/css-background-patterns/).
